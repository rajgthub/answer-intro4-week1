 2. ### HTML/CSS Project

  Create a new webpage on a subject that you're interested in (maybe the same topic you used for your Codepen submission).    The page should **NOT** use any framework like Bootstrap and it should include the following elements:
  - The `.html` page and a linked `.css` file applies a consistent color scheme to links and text on your page.
  - A page header with a title and description for the site.
  - An articles section with three articles, each including a title, summary and a link.
  - A page footer containing info about you or the site.
  - Proper use of the semantic HTML tags we discussed.
  - Research the `:first-child` pseudo-class and use it to style the first article so that it stands out from the others.
  - Use this website [Lorem Ipsum](http://www.lipsum.com/) to generate random blocks of contents to fill your website.
  - **Commit often (with good meaningful commit messages), and Push to Github regularly.**
  - Use the sketch below to guide you towards the layout and content you are trying to achieve. *Please note that this is just a sketch - you can choose the colours, fonts and images that you want to use in the page.*
